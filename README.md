# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim based Neovim configuration

For best results, this Neovim config has the following prerequisites:

1. Make sure that Python is installed and in $PATH
2. Make sure that Node is installed and in $PATH
3. All other prerequisites are best installed via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)
    1. The Scoopfile found in [this repository](https://github.com/michael-taylor/scoop-persist) is the simplest way to install all prerequisites at once.
